# Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML

As part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree this project was designed to apply transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate data into a workable format. Evaluate supervised learners and optimize the final model.

The key takeaways learned from this project are:

- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.
